Mayonnaise could contain sulfites as well. The only one I've come across that doesn't is Chosen Foods avocado oil mayo. \n\nEssentially, sulfites have to do with how a food is processed. So one brand of a food item might be safe while another is not. The biggest dangers are emulsifying or bonding ingredients like lecithin/cellulose/maltodextrin/food staches, preservatives like citric acid/tocopherols/guar or xanthan gums/citric acid. Oils are also rough. Corn, vegetable, or canola oils are all sulfited. Any sugar supplement or sweetener will contain sulfites too like corn syrup, glucose, stevia, sucralose, or aspartame.\n\nThe easiest way to begin this lifestyle is when you're shopping at the grocery, never go to the center aisles. Everything you can eat will be on the edges like produce, meats, etc. Cook everything from scratch.

For years I would experience symptoms which usually appeared shortly after eating. I did allergy and intolerance tests and excluded problematic foods- gluten, dairy and eggs. However, my symptoms persevered. And that when I noticed reaction after eating fried potatoes, drinking fizzy drinks, mayo, lemon juice, gluten free bolognese cooked with red wine and some gluten free products with sulphur dioxide.  My symptoms are heart palpitations, brain fog, nervousness, paranoid thinking, upset tummy, flushed face, dry mouth. Could other relate to that?"}]
