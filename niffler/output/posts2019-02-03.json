For years I would experience symptoms which usually appeared shortly after eating. I did allergy and intolerance tests and excluded problematic foods- gluten, dairy and eggs. However, my symptoms persevered. And that when I noticed reaction after eating fried potatoes, drinking fizzy drinks, mayo, lemon juice, gluten free bolognese cooked with red wine and some gluten free products with sulphur dioxide.  My symptoms are heart palpitations, brain fog, nervousness, paranoid thinking, upset tummy, flushed face, dry mouth. Could other relate to that?", "updated_time": "2019-02-01T08:54:46+0000"}]
