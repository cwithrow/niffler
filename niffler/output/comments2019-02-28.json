If you can, find bread from a local bakery where you can ask directly what ingredients they use. Also, most flour is bleached and through this process becomes sulfited. Mayonnaise could contain sulfites as well. The only one I've come across that doesn't is Chosen Foods avocado oil mayo. \n\nEssentially, sulfites have to do with how a food is processed. So one brand of a food item might be safe while another is not. The biggest dangers are emulsifying or bonding ingredients like lecithin/cellulose/maltodextrin/food staches, preservatives like citric acid/tocopherols/guar or xanthan gums/citric acid. Oils are also rough. Corn, vegetable, or canola oils are all sulfited. Any sugar supplement or sweetener will contain sulfites too like corn syrup, glucose, stevia, sucralose, or aspartame.\n\nThe easiest way to begin this lifestyle is when you're shopping at the grocery, never go to the center aisles. Everything you can eat will be on the edges like produce, meats, etc. Cook everything from scratch.
